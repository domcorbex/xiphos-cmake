  <!-- Journals and Prayer Lists -->

  <title>Journals and Prayer Lists</title>

  <p><app>Xiphos</app> supports	user-created and -editable modules to contain
  general content.  Initially conceived as simple prayer lists,	they have
  expanded to include daily journals and topic-outline content.  The user can
  maintain prayer lists, or prepare sermons, or write any structured content
  desired.</p>

  <p>To enable prayer list and journal support, see the	Preferences dialog as
  previously described.  There, in <guiseq><gui>General</gui><gui> Options
  </gui></guiseq>, check the item labeled <gui>Enable Prayer Lists</gui>.
  You will see a new item appear at the bottom of the sidebar's module list for
  "Prayer Lists/Journals".</p>

  <p>Right-click on this entry, and you will be offered a context menu to create
  new modules.  All the offered options are of the same type, but what is
  offered is a variety of templates from which to work.  There are 6 templates
  at this time.</p>

  <media type="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/journal.png" />

  <p>Their structure is the same, but the offered templates provide a variety of
  hints regarding ways to organize content.  <gui>Simple</gui> is trivial, and
  can be considered a mental Post-It note.  <gui>Subject</gui> is useful as
  a more organized version.
  <gui>Monthly</gui> provides a per-month structure in  which to track needed
  content.
  <gui>Daily Journal</gui> is a full 365-day calendar in which to track a
  personal journal or ongoing prayer needs.
  <gui>Outlined Topic</gui> is a full, expandable outline suitable for topics
  and subtopics.
  <gui>Book/Chapter</gui> is a book and chapter outline from Genesis through
  Revelation.</p>

  <p>Journals and prayer lists have the structure of a general book: If simply
  selected for display from the module list, they will appear in the usual
  subwindow for general books.</p>

  <p>Editing a journal or prayer list is done by right-clicking the module name
  to get its context menu, whose middle item is <gui>Open in Editor</gui>.  The
  sections and subsections will be listed in the left margin.  Click one, and
  the editor navigates to that section.  The context menu on right-click of
  section keys provides for adding, deleting, and editing the names of sections
  and subsections.</p>

  <p>If the general book subwindow is currently displaying the journal or prayer
  list being edited, it will synchronize with new content when <gui>Save</gui>
  is used.</p>

  <p>As mentioned, these user-edited modules are in effect general books.  This
  means they can be viewed in any Sword Project application.  Thus, you can use
  these modules immediately in <app>BibleTime</app>, for example; or from the
  Module Manager's <gui>Maintenance</gui> page, you can archive a zip file to
  copy to a Windows system where you can then install the zip content as a
  module for the Windows user interface.  Few other Sword Project applications
  provide for editing these modules, however, meaning that they will appear in
  such other applications as just ordinary general books.</p>

  <p>In the future, it is planned that a module sharing facility will become
  available, by which user-edited modules such as these can be uploaded to
  become available to a wide audience.  The current install repository facility
  will be expanded to provide upload as well as the existing download capability
  in order to support this.  Thus, users will be able to share their sermons,
  Bible studies, and other personally-authored content with other Sword
  application users.</p>
