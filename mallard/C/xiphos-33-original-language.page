    <title>Installing Needed Modules</title>

    <p>Xiphos is ideally suited for studying the original Greek and Hebrew. To
    get started, you will want the following modules:</p>

    <p>From Crosswire Repository:</p>
    <list>
      <item>
	<p>StrongsHebrew Dictionary (or get StrongsRealHebrew from the Xiphos
	Repository)</p>
      </item>
      <item>
	<p>StrongsGreek Dictionary (or get StrongsRealGreek from the Xiphos
	Repository)</p>
      </item>
      <item>
	<p>Robinson Dictionary</p>
      </item>
      <item>
	<p>KJV Bible</p>
      </item>
    </list>

    <p>From Xiphos Repository:</p>
    <list>
      <item>
	<p>StrongsRealGreek Dictionary (same as StrongsGreek, but with Greek
	characters, B-Greek transliteration, and self-referencing links)</p>
      </item>
      <item>
	<p>StrongsRealHebrew Dictionary (same as StrongsHebrew, but with Hebrew
	characters and self-referencing links)</p>
      </item>
      <item>
	<p>InvertedStrongsRealGreek (key in or copy actual Greek word, rather
	than number)</p>
      </item>
    </list>
  </section>

    <title>Setting Up</title>

    <p>While still in the module manager, create indexes for all of the modules
    you just installed. Then close the module manager and open <guiseq><gui>Edit
    </gui><gui>	Preferences</gui></guiseq> and go to <guiseq><gui>Modules</gui>
    <gui>Misc</gui></guiseq>. Set your Hebrew and Greek lexicons according to
    what you installed.
    Close preferences and open the KJV module. Turn on the module options
    <guiseq><gui>Right Click</gui><gui>Module Options</gui><gui>Show Strongs
    </gui></guiseq> and <guiseq><gui>Right Click</gui><gui>Module Options
    </gui><gui>Show Morphology</gui></guiseq>. You should see the Bible text
    change to show Strongs numbers underneath the appropriate English words.
    Hover over the numbers (or letters for morphology) with the mouse and you
    will see the definition displayed in the previewer pane. Click on the link
    and the definition will show in the dictionary pane. If you are using
    StrongsRealGreek or	StrongsRealHebrew, you can click on any other number
    referenced in the definition and you will be taken to that entry.</p>

  <section id="orig-lang-search">

    <title>Searching for Strongs Numbers</title>

    <p>Choose <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Advanced Search</gui></guiseq>or press
    <key>F3</key>. Under <gui>Search Type</gui>, select <gui>Optimized
    ("Lucene")</gui>. Click on the <gui>Attribute Search</gui> tab, and make
    check the box that says <gui>Strongs Numbers</gui>. Now click in the entry
    field at the top and search for the number you are looking for preceded by
    "lemma:" and "G" for Greek or "H" for Hebrew. So to look for the Hebrew word
    tsad-deek (6662), enter "lemma:H6662". Once the search is done, the results
    pane will be shown. Notice that when you click on a result, it will show the
    result in the preview pane, and the strong's numbers will show as well,
    following immediately after the words they match. Also note that hovering
    over these numbers will show the definition in the main preview pane.</p>
