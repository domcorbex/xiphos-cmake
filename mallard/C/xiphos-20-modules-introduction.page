  <title>Introduction To The Module Manager</title>

  <p>The "module" is the unit of content in <app>Xiphos</app>, and Sword generally; a Sword
  module is a resource available for viewing in Sword applications.  There are several
  varieties: Most importantly, Bible texts, as well as dictionaries and lexicons, commentaries,
  and general books, any of which may include image content (e.g. atlases).  They are installed
  either from a local directory structure (typically on removable media, such as a CDROM
  distribution) or remotely via ftp from a repository such as Crosswire, which is the home of
  Sword, and from which all officially Sword-sanctioned modules are available.  Also, many other
  modules are available from non-Crosswire repositories.  In particular, there is the Xiphos
  repository, containing a variety of otherwise-unofficial modules produced primarily by
  contributors to <app>Xiphos</app> itself.</p>

  <p>If you have other Sword applications installed, they will all share the same set of Sword
  modules that you install through the Module Manager.</p>
