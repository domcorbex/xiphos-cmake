  <title>Advanced Searches</title>

  <p>More complicated searches might require the use of the advanced search functions, found
  under	<guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Advanced Search</gui></guiseq>.</p>

  <media style="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/search_search.png" />

  <p>In <gui>Advanced Search</gui>, much more complex queries can be constructed, involving
  custom search ranges,	custom lists of modules over which to search, regular expression
  matching (see next section), and attribute-based searches such as are found in footnotes
  or Strong's Hebrew and Greek dictionary references.</p>

  <p>The default search uses "lucene" fast searching.  It is an optimized search requiring a
  pre-built index; see the <gui>Module Manager's</gui> Maintenance page for index creation.
  In the absence of an index, fallback to the slower, plain multi-word search will be done,
  or can be selected deliberately here.  A web search will provide several references to the
  syntax needed to put to use the power of optimized Lucene search. A few examples follow:</p>

  <p>Simple Searches: just type in the words you want to search for. To return only verses that
  include all of the words, prefix the word with "+". So, in the KJV, you could find Psalm 23
  by searching for "+Lord +shepherd +want". To search for an entire phrase, surround the entire
  phrase with quotes, like "maketh me to lie down" (note that quotes are unnecessary in all
  of the other examples).</p>

  <p>Single Letter Wildcard: to search for "veil" or "vail", use this syntax "v?il". The "?"
  represents a single character	that could be anything. A more complex example returns both
  spellings for Isaiah used in the KJV. "?saia?" will return results for "Isaiah" and
  "Esaias".</p>

  <p>Multiple Letter Wildcard: to search for "prophet" or "prophesy" or "prophecy" or
  "prophesied", use this syntax "prophe*".</p>

  <p>AND syntax: in the advanced search to return results for all of the search terms, you
  must put "AND" in between the terms. To continue our example, if we wish to search for any
  occurrence of Isaiah or Esaias that also mention either prophet, or prophecy, or prophesy,
  we can do a search like this: "?saia? AND prophe*".</p>

  <p>By default, two standard search ranges are defined, for Old and New Testament; you may
  wish to define others for e.g. "Gospels" or "Paul's Epistles". One custom module list
  containing only the first Bible found will be present. If desired, new searches can be
  performed across only the current results of the previous search.  Any modules may be
  searched, including general books and even dictionaries, in any combination.</p>

  <p>Note the tooltip in the screenshot above, for Attributes search.  This qualifier is used
  to perform searches on attributes that are carried with verses, instead of verse content
  proper, such as footnote content or Strong's Hebrew and Greek	references.  If this button
  is selected, specific attribute qualifiers must be made in the Attribute Search tab, at the
  right end of the tab set.  Strong's references are identified with a leading "H" or "G" and
  the numeric Strong's identifier. Thus, a search of KJV for Strong's Greek #140, using "G140",
  will return the single result of Matthew 12:18.</p>

  <p>If you have indexed your modules, there is a much faster way to search for Strong's
  references. Enter your search preceded by "lemma:", so to search for Strong's Greek #140,
  enter "lemma:G140". You must have selected <gui>Optimized ("Lucene")</gui> for this to
  work.</p>

  <p>Explanations of search syntax are available when either Optimized or Attribute search is
  selected.</p>

  <p>The "Find" button also stops an in-progress search, as its tooltip indicates.</p>

  <p>Results will show in the <gui>Results</gui> tab. If you wish to show Strongs, Morphology,
  or Footnote tags, make those selections on the <gui>Attributes Search</gui> tab. Clicking
  once on the result will show the result in the <gui>Advanced Search</gui> previewer. Hovering
  over Strongs, Morphology, Footnote, or Cross-reference tags will show the results in the main
  previewer. Double-clicking a result will cause the current tab to navigate to that result.
  This applies to search results in general books and commentaries as well, but note that the
  respective tab must be visible.</p>

  <note style="warning">
    <p>Changes to some of the settings (e.g. scope of search, searched modules, etc.) in
    Advanced Search will affect the simple search via the side pane but not vice versa.</p>
