  <!-- ============= Search  ============--> 

  <title>Simple Searches</title>

  <p>To conduct a quick search within the current Bible or commentary module, the Search Bar
  in the Sidebar should usually be adequate. Click either in the menu bar <guiseq><gui>Edit
  </gui><gui>Search</gui></guiseq> or in the Sidebar <guiseq><gui>Modules</gui><gui>Search</gui>
  </guiseq> to access it.</p>

  <media style="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/interface_searchpane.png" />

  <p>The <gui>Search Dialog</gui> consists of the following parts:</p>

  <list>
    <item>
      <p>Search Key Entry box</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Search Module Selector</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Search Type Selector</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Search Options Checkbox</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Search Scope Selector</p>

      <p>Search Results View</p>
    </item>
  </list>

  <section id="xiphos-search-key">

    <title>Search Key Entry Box</title>

    <p>Allows entry of the key for which you would like to search. The search key can be a
    word, part of a word, several words, a phrase, or a regular expression depending on the
    type of search selected. When the search key is entered and all other selections in the
    search dialog are complete, click the <gui>Find</gui> button to begin the search.</p>

    <p>This search uses the optimized search method (see next section) if the module has
    previously been indexed, and will use AND semantics by default (matched verses contain
    all words you entered).</p>

  </section>

  <section id="xiphos-search-modselect">

    <title>Search Module Selector</title>

    <p>Allows selection of which modules you would like to search. Select <gui>Bible</gui>
    to search Bible versions or <gui>Commentary</gui> to search commentaries. Only the
    currently active module will be searched.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="xiphos-search-typeselect">

    <title>Search Type Selector</title>

    <p>Allows selection of the type of search. There are three search types available:</p>

    <terms>
      <item>
	<title><gui>Multi word</gui></title>

	<p>This type will match any verse that has all the words in the search key,
	regardless of where they appear in the verse.  By default, "lucene" fast search
        will be used, with fallback to the slower plain version of multi-word search in
	the absence of an index.</p>
      </item>

      <item>
	<title><gui>Regular expression</gui></title> 
	<p>This search uses a regular expression as a search key. A regular expression is a
	pattern used to match a string of text. A regular expression can be used to find
	verses with words that match a particular pattern. For example the regular expression
	<input>[a-z]*iah </input> will match verses that contain the words Aiah, Ahaziah,
	Athaliah and Amariah.</p>

	<p>A complete discussion of regular expressions is beyond the scope of this manual,
	but more information can be found in the grep man page.</p>
      </item>

      <item>
	<title><gui>Exact phrase</gui></title>

	<p>This type will match the search key exatly as entered. If the search key is
	<input>it is good</input>, this search would match a verse which contains "<em>it
	is good</em>," but would not match a verse which contains "<em>good</em>, and
	doeth <em>it</em> not, to him it <em>is</em> sin."</p>
      </item>

    </terms>
  </section>

  <section id="xiphos-search-options">

    <title>Search Options Checkbox</title>

    <p>Allows selecting of search options. The only available option is <gui>Match case</gui>.
    Check this box to make the search case sensitive.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="xiphos-search-scopeselect">

    <title>Search Scope Selector</title>

    <p>Allows defining the range within the specificed module that will	be searched. There
    are three search scopes available:</p>

    <terms>
      <item>
	<title><gui>No scope</gui></title>

	<p>This button causes the search to include the entire module.</p>
      </item>

      <item>
	<title><gui>Use bounds</gui></title>

	<p>Selecting this button produces two dropdown selector boxes marked <gui>Lower</gui>
	and <gui>Upper</gui>. Select the first book to search in the <gui>Lower</gui> box and
	the last book to search in the <gui>Upper</gui> box. The search will begin with the
	<gui>Lower</gui> book and end with the <gui>Upper</gui> book and include all books in
	between.</p>

	<p>Chapter and verse numbers can be entered into the search bound boxes as well to
	further narrow the search. </p>
      </item>

      <item>
	<title><gui>Last search</gui></title>

	<p>Select this button to do a new search including only the verses returned as a result
	of the last search. Use this with a new search key to narrow the search further.</p>
      </item>
