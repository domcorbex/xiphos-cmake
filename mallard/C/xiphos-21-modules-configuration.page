  <title>Sword Modules Configuration</title>

    <title>Module Sources Settings</title>

    <p>There are other repositories available besides CrossWire's own, though the modules
    available from other repositories do not represent content officially sanctioned by
    Crosswire.  On the web, see this page for list of those repositories known:
    <link href="http://www.crosswire.org/wiki/Module_Repositories">
    http://www.crosswire.org/wiki/Module_Repositories</link></p>

    <p>The list of standard repositories is maintained at CrossWire.  Xiphos normally
    auto-synchronizes with that list one time, when the user first puts the Module Manager to
    use.  The list may change, as new repositories come into existence;	occasional
    re-synchronization with the list is suggested, which is accomplished by clicking <gui>
    Load Standard</gui>.</p>

  <section id="installation">
    <title>Sword Module Installations</title>
    <media style="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/sword_config.png" width="700" />

    <p>After you have selected your Install Source, click the <gui>Refresh</gui> button to cause
    <app>Xiphos</app> to find the module summary available from that source before moving on.</p>

    <p>Take note of the "Install Destination". In most cases, you will have a choice of a
    personal area or a system area. The details vary according to your operating system.</p>

    <section id="destination-linux">
      <title>Linux</title>
      <p>Unless you run as root (via su or sudo) you will only be able to install in your
      personal area, under ~/.sword. If you run as root, or change permissions on the shared
      directory, you will also be able to install modules for all users, typically in
      /usr/share/sword. There have been some requests for Xiphos to provide a means by which
      an ordinary (non-root) user could start the program, gain temporary write access to the
      system area while installing modules, and then revoke that access after installation is
      complete.  Attempting to devise a scheme to do this has proven quite difficult, given
      the different superuser management schemes employed by various Linux distributions.
      Therefore, at this time there are no ongoing plans to try to solve this problem, and
      users are advised to enable write access to the system area outside Xiphos.</p>

    <section id="destination-xp">
      <title>Windows XP</title>
      <p>You may install modules to a shared folder so the modules are available to all users.
      If you have previously used "The Sword Project for Windows", this folder will be
      "C:\Program Files\Crosswire\The Sword Project\Sword". Otherwise it will be
      "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Sword". You may also install
      modules to a location that can only be seen by you. This location is "C:\Documents
      and Settings\YOUR NAME\Application Data\Sword".</p>
    </section>

    <section id="destination-vista">
      <title>Windows Vista</title>
      <p>Vista works much the same as XP, except for the locations. The private location is
      "C:\Users\YOUR NAME\AppData\Roaming\Sword". The shared location is
      "C:\ProgramData\Sword".</p>
