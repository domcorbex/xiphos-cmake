  <p>BibleSync is a shared navigation protocol using LAN multicast.  It is
  useful for a single person when running Bible programs on multiple machines
  or devices, all of which you wish to navigate through the Bible together, or
  for a group working closely together, such as translators.  Also, it has a
  "lecture" mode, where a speaker's Bible program induces the audience's
  programs to follow along.
  The difference in the modes regards who transmits and who receives
  navigation.  In Personal mode, BibleSync navigation is both	transmitted and
  received; as Speaker, it transmits only; as Audience, it receives only.</p>

  <p>To enable BibleSync, select a mode from the radio buttons.  Also, choose
  whether to accept navigation directly, so that Xiphos moves	immediately to a
  specified verse, or whether incoming navigation is instead sent to the verse
  list, where you can decide whether to follow.</p>

  <p>If you use a firewall, you must punch a hole in it for UDP port 22272.</p>

  <p>If you run more than one BibleSync-compatible program on your computer
  and do not wish your activity among them to be shared on the local net, you
  can use Personal mode combined with the Private checkbox.  This will tell
  <app>Xiphos</app> not to broadcast outside your system.</p>

  <p>You can send a verse list from the sidebar search or Advanced Search
  window via BibleSync; see the context (right-click) menu.  A particularly
  good use case for this is when using a simpler Bible program, such as on a
  mobile device, with another such as	<app>Xiphos</app> that has significant
  search capability: Do searches in <app>Xiphos</app> and send the resulting
  verse list to the mobile device.  Be aware that size limitations on the
  protocol are small, and though a search may	generate hundreds of results
  in the verse list, at most a few dozen will pass in the protocol to the
  receivers.  For <app>Xiphos</app>, receipt of multi-references always
  induces indirect verse list navigation.</p>

  <p><app>Xiphos</app> is the first Bible program with a BibleSync
  implementation; as such, its utility may be limited for now.  But a number
  of other programs' authors and support organizations have indicated their
  intention to support BibleSync as well, including Laridian, theWord,
  BibleAnalyzer, and Accordance, as well as other Sword Project
  applications.</p>
